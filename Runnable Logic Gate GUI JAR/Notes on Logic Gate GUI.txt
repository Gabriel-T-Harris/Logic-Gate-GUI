Due to issues with loading HTML pages from a JAR the HTML stuff is stored outside of the JAR.

The issue has to do with the HTML pages requiring absolute paths, while the application uses relative paths.

The JAR still contains the html files in the Resource folder within the JAR.

An alternate soultion would be to turn the HTML pages into pictures.
